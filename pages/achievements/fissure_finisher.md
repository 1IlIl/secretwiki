Deal 1,000,000 total damage in rated games. Damage to opponents, their minions, and their towers is all that counts. Damage to protection shield does not count.Damage to own minions does not count. Damage past a minion/player/tower's health counts, so one strategy I employed was using magma bomb vs towers, which has a high chance of hitting over 150 damage.
