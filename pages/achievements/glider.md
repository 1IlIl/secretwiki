## ![Glider_Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1IlIl/wikidata/main/achievement_icons/Glider.png) Glider

Cast enough Protection Shield that you aren't going to take any damage to health.


Cast Glide.


I suggest you have an opponent launch you in a way that stuns you(any damaging spell), and stay airborne for some specific duration. Doesnâ€™t require an opponent, but having static bath combo is not possible solo without losing glide.


Use peg/bloodbath/static shield strat from Up, Up, and Up some more for ez height.
