## Arcane Bomb

Arcane Bomb is another basic, yet unique spell. Arcane bomb follows many bomb mechanics, then as it explodes for 10 damage, it spawns three arcane arrows from the explosion which each do 10 damage.

Much like Arcane arrow, and surprisingly, much unlike other bombs with sub-projectiles. “Stuffing” Arcane Bomb is a valid way to ensure it does maximum damage.

Because Arcane Bomb uses bomb mechanics first, and must “wait” for a second after being thrown and before exploding, this timer can be used to wait out the deactivation of shields like wind and flame shield by throwing the bomb form at the shield to deactivate, and then having the arrows ignore the shield.

Because of the arrows having their own knockback, Arcane Bomb has slightly more knockback than Arcane Flash when stuffed. Now this is not something that I have confirmed, but aiming the arcane arrows upward(targetting far above the player) when doing things like this is supposedly optimal. Something to note is that the direction of knockback is not always intuitive. A low bomb tends to launch more sideways than you would think when inside the player.

Something flashy that I use from time to time is the ability to knock arcane bomb off terrain such that it stays in the air long enough to explode outside of the map. This can be useful for hitting people on the “side” of grassy.

Something to keep in mind is that when you use arcane bomb, it breaks the terrain and knocks back before firing the arrows, so sometimes you need to aim not where the player is, but where they will be.
