## Arcane Flash

Arcane Flash, like Arcane Gate, is an extremely popular spell. There is so much information from this section that I almost would classify as necessary to play arc at any competitive level, however at it’s core Arcane Flash is simply a low damage spell that flings players and minions.

Now the origin of flash is something that is very important .By itself, Flash’s explosion is centered at roughly the edge of your player in the direction  that you aim it. This is incredibly important to using flash to its fullest. Something fairly simple to understand is that flashing towards your target is less reliable than aiming away from your opponent. This is due to the distance of the center of the explosion from your opponent. The closer this is, the more that its angle will affect the resulting trajectory.

Something else to consider with flash is that extend, (by default holding the alt key) will like all spells move the origin of the spell from the player.This can be incredibly useful for flash, and enables something called reverse flashing, in which the player extends the origin past the opponent such that they fly towards you rather than away.

*reading the old wiki* I’m sure there’s many more things to discuss about flash. Ah yes. Arcane Flash has a disjoint knockback hitbox compared to it’s terrain cutout.This can lead to being able to hit people with the damage and knockback, but not destroy the terrain they are standing on.

Something else to talk about with flash is how it interacts with minions. A player on a mountable minion can be flashed off of it.

Something that might not always click immediately is that a player can also be flashed through their own mountable minions. A minion that is not on their team or is not mountable however will act as a solid object.

Something that might not always click even more so is that you can flash mounts without dismounting their riders. This is incredibly powerful against minions like Mountain Goat and Water Lord, where you can send both rider and mount into the drink together.This is accomplished by hitting the mount, but not the player with the flash knockback.

As a final note, I will address the myth that there is a curve on the flash knockback. What this means is that people have previously hypothesized that there was some sort of reduced or increased knockback based on distance from the center of the flash. I have run tests and I can tell you affirmatively that there is indeed no more or less than 33 force applied at any point on the hitbox.
