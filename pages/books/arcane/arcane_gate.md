## Arcane Gate

Arcane Gate is Arcane Gate. 99% of books should have it. Bring it, Use it, Not much else to say.

One thing to keep in mind is that the falling player is affected by certain spells such as Nature’s Wrath. This means that if you gate too high off terrain, it will push you. If you gate very close to terrain however, you will not be pushed by wrath. The last thing I will say is while there are not many “tricks” with Arcane Gate,however there is a great deal of strategy around when and where to gate. I am not sure where to put such strategy but for now I’ve decided to not put it here.
