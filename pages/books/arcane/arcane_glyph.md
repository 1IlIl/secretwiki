## Arcane Glyph 

Arcane Glyph summons up to 10 “glyphs” in a circle around the player. While Arcane Glyphs do not have many uses, they have a few important ones like with imps.

These glyphs are blocked by terrain(they will not summon inside it), however they will summon inside minions and going off immediately.

Arcane Glyphs can be useful for blocking opponents or charging your imps, but it can also be used for things like killing Forest Seed.
