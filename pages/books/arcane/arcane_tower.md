## Arcane Tower

Arcane Tower, you know it, a basic spell which is pretty unique. Arcane Tower is a 25HP tower which heals from arcane damage. It can heal all the way to 100HP.

Arcane tower is also the only tower which is retained when using Arcane Gate.

Something to mention is that this gate effect will not work if you cast it within water.

The tower will come with you, however it comes with 0 hp and you will detower immediately after. The trick to Arcane Tower, and the trick to avoid this is to gate into something that will deal arcane damage. This could be glyphs,sigils, or arcane mist for example. These will let you keep the tower.

Something that can be situationally useful is to dig downward in Arcane Tower. This can be useful to get out of auras for example. The trick to this is to use full power or even extend.

What happens if you use low power? Well this is also a useful tool in a different way. Using low power will not dig you far but will heal you.

If you donâ€™t want to dig at all, you can curve the arrows close enough to hit the top of the tower.

Something important to note is that the initial damage of Arcane Meteor is not actually arcane and will not heal the tower. Another thing to mention though is the arcane arrows and subsequent glyphs created by the meteor will sometimes handle keeping you in your tower.
