Imp Destruction is a simple, but extremely powerful spell which converts impâ€™s HP into arcane arrows. 10 hp becomes 1 arrow, or 10 damage, however Arcane Energizer does affect the damage of these arrows.

Imp destruction is not always the right answer, however it sometimes comes in handy, especially when your opponent is flighted against the top of the map, or if there is some reason that you cannot get your imps near them. Something to note here is that the opponent will move around a lot and imp des can sometimes be very ineffective. Having the opponent being away from the imps and also being against terrain to stop them from moving will greatly improve the effectiveness of this spell.In addition to this. Imp des is generally better when you have a large amount of imps that are max health. This spell can make charging imps be square one again, so being sure to use it only when it will be effective is very important.
