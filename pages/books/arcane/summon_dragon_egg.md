## Summon Dragon Egg 

Arcane Egg is a rather interesting spell that replaces Arcane Zero Shield in Arcanists 2. Based on its health, it summons different variants of dragons.
- **Under 25 HP** it will summon a **Baby Dragon**.
- **Between 25 and 149 HP** it will summon the **Adolescent Dragon**.
- **At 150 HP** it will summon A **random fully grown dragon** that is either Flame, Frost, or Storm.

The Baby Dragon has Arcane Flash and 2 casts of Arcane Glyphs
The Adolescent Dragon has a small 50 damage melee spell that does not hurt the caster.
The Adult Dragons all have their normal spells.

The Baby Dragon is not mountable, however both the Adolescent Dragon and the Adult Dragons are.

The Dragon egg can be either charged by arcane spells similarly to imps, however they also passively gain 10HP per turn. This can make getting a Baby Dragon more difficult than any other, as by the time your turn comes back after summoning it, it will be 35 health.

Something unique to Adolescent Dragon is that it cannot hold a Dark Knight or Paladin, however it can hold the player and Recall Devices.

In addition to this, Adolescent Dragon also heals passively 15 per turn.

Something rather unique about Dragon Egg is that it triggers the death of the Egg when it summons the dragon. This means that spells like resurrection can bring it back before the dragon dies.This can lead to some interesting loops in logic that can be used to acquire many dragons.

One last thing that I will mention about Dragon Egg is that there is a secret mechanic or trick of sorts to hatch Cog Dragons.This can be done by killing a Dragon Egg with a Clockwork Bomb. The challenge here is that Clockwork bomb will not always explode soon enough that the Egg has not gained too much HP to survive the explosion. This must be the explosion and not the cogs that are generated. The cogs from clockwork bomb can kill the egg without hatching a Cog Dragon.
