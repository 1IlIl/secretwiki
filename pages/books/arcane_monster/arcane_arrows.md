Arcane Monster gets a version of Arcane Arrows that spawns 10 arrows instead of 4. This deals 100 damage. These arrows can become a bit unwieldy due to them destroying the land that the opponent is standing on or otherwise moving the opponent. To avoid this, both the knockback direction must be controlled as well as where the arrows hit. If the arrows hit directly opposite of the terrain ,the player will not move at all as the terrain they are standing on will be minimally damaged. An alternate strategy with the arrows is to extend them such that the knockback brings the opponent towards you.
