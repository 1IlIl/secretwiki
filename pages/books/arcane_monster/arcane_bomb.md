## Arcane Bomb

Arcane Monsterâ€™s Arcane Bomb deals 10 damage from the flash, spawns 9 arrows which each deal 10 damage, and spawns an Arcane Mist aura which will also deal 15 damage. This makes Arcane Bomb the strongest attack in the Arcane Monster Toolkit. Something to note here is that to do maximum damage, the arcane monster wants to stuff the bomb into the player.

Something that can be difficult as Arcane Monster is dealing damage to Full Illusion Players. This is due to their size.

There is a trick I developed to handle this.To line this up, place your closer foot directly on top of the opponent and then extend at the second from the lowest angle. This will reliably stick the bomb into the player.
