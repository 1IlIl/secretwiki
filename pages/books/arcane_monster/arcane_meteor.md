## Arcane Meteor


Arcane Meteor is the same spell as the Arcane Meteor Armageddon. It breaks some land, and on itâ€™s last explosion clears shield similarly to sanc and generates a portal to a random location.Something important to note about this spell is it deals non-arcane damage initially, which can and will hurt the Arcane Monster.

Something to note is that the sanc effect requires land to work. It cannot function against all targets, and especially struggles vs flight and static shield effects.
