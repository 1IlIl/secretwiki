## Arcane Portal

Arcane portal is an interesting augmentation to the map. It connects two points and can be traversed from either entrance by a player or (fitting) projectile once per turn.

Arcane portal scales with the caster’s size. This means that you can use Holiday familiar, Presents and a large minion, Arcane Monster, or Arcane Dragon(Arcane Monster) to generate much larger portals.

Something to note is that these larger portals can move larger projectiles. Things like Mega Boulder and Meteor, which are previously unable to go through a portal, can traverse these larger ones.

Something to note is that portals and mountable minions have some unique interaction.With a normal sized portal and a mountable minion that does not fit, the rider, if it fits, can be “grabbed” off the minion and to the other side of the portal.

With larger portals, the minion will try to bring the rider with it.

There is the possibility that the rider is handing off the minion, and this can cause the rider to be grabbed without the mount regardless of portal size.

Something interesting about the way portals work is that you can use them to stack minions perfectly on top of eachother. The brine cannon is a famous strategy for creating large knockback for the up, up, up, and away achievement.

Something that is important to note is that at the start of the turn, what is in the portal will be moved to the other side. This can be very useful because it acts as sort of a toggle based on which players turn it is. You can be near your opponent on your turn when you can cast spells, but far away from your opponent and unreachable on their turn. As an added effect, an activated portal like this cannot be used to reach you. One response would be for the opponent to get on the other side of the portal and toggle with you, such that if each end of the portal is unreachable from the other end, you and your opponent become unreachable.

Portal can also be used to grab an opponent towards you. This can be used to pull an opponent out of a static shield or possibly into arma. It really depends on the situation, but it is useful to know about. The trick to pulling this off is to overlap the portal summon circle with the player border. It can be done by precisely aiming it next to the player.

Something slightly more difficult, but very possible is to move people away from you with a portal. This is the most powerful use of what is referred to as portal grabbing and placing an opponent at any point in the map has many uses. A common use is simply to move them over the water so that they fall and sink.This can be fairly difficult to line up or position given the opponent’s location, however things like flight, or using on an opponent who is flighted can be very simple, albeit sometimes time consuming.
