ha! No. You do not get an Arcane Tower as an Arcane Monster. Something to note here is that Arcane Tower seems like the perfect weapon for fighting against Arcane Monster right? Well itâ€™s not due to a mechanic called Arcane Fountain.If an Arcane Monster Flashes an Arcane Tower, the towered player is detowered as well as a fairly flashy amount of arrows are fired from it.

These arrows have a significant amount of phasing upon cast, so they are difficult to use as a Monster to heal with.
