Arcane Monster is an augmentation to the Arcane book that is only accessible to people with the Arcane Monster tag. While not all of these tags have been obtained have been this way, the way to get Arcane Monster is by completing the Arcane Monster Challenge, which put simply involves beating an Arcane Monster in a 1v1. I canâ€™t stay on top of this here, so if you would like to attempt the challenge, reach out to a mod and ask them for the updated rules and requirements.

An Arcane Monster is characterized by a larger character, A purplized map, 500 health, and the ability to heal from arcane damage. In addition to the obvious differences, Arcane Monster gets a powerful version of the Arcane book as well as some additional spells. Arcane Monster is heavy, similarly to Dark Knight, meaning that you cannot flash them off the map as easily. Arcane Monster gets a built in 4HP resistance to damage, similar to lv4 of the Stone familiar.

How does Arcane Monster work from the Monster perspective you ask? Once you have the role, you simply put all arcane spells in your book and upon spawning into sandbox, you will have the book and extras. If you would like to play Arcane Monster in multiplayer, you must play in a game in which the Arcane Monster setting is enabled.
