## Fire Arrow


Fire Arrow is again a very moderate spell. It acts like an arrow would and in the most baseline way. You target it and it curves where you aim as best as it can.

There will be a section of this wiki all about arrows and tricks regarding them , so I will not say much about this here.Something I will say is that if you would like to sink a player with a flame arrow, you will have much more luck fighting as little as you can with gravity. This means hitting the player more sideways than up. It can be simple to just launch them as close to 45 degrees as you can, but it’s not always optimal and sometimes you must go sideways more to successfully sink.

I said I wasn’t going to, but I decided I am. I will touch briefly on a concept known as drop arrows. This refers to utilizing the later phases of the arrow mechanics to hit an opponent. It’s a bit complicated so I leave you to go to that section of the wiki, however I will show this one tip that works very well with an arrow with a slightly larger AOE like flame arrow. Put simply, aim where I am, and try to get a very flat angle downwards at the point that the arrow crosses the target on the arrow and it will hit the side of grassy easily. A steeper angle or a target more outside the map will hit higher on the side of grassy, and lower target is usually used to hit lower side of grassy.
