## Flame Shield


<span style="color:red">This needs to be updated due to the shield duration changes</span>


Flame shield is a spell that applies a flame shield effect(deflecting spells) to the player which deactivates after blocking a spell and lasts 5 turns.

Something important to understand is that flame shield only blocks one spell between your turn starting, and the  next time your turn starts. This means in teams format or with armageddon, Flame Shield will block one spell, but not all spells.

Something else very very important about flame shield is that it only blocks in a specific hitbox above it. Casting a spell from below the flame shield will not block it.

I happen to have this nice image to explain where this hitbox is roughly.

Putting together some of the previous mechanics, you might want to bftp and disable the shield such that your main projectile is unaffected. Something to note is it’s not that you need the bftp to enter this marked area, but you actually need the bftp to be affected by the shield. This means it needs to be coming towards the user.

There are a few strategies to accomplish this, however the easiest is just to stand on their head and bftp directly down. Not an incredibly popular strategy, however it does work.

Another simple strategy is to fire it from above directly towards the player. Aiming too low will not work so it must be towards the hitbox.

Another somewhat common strategy is to fire a bftp into the terrain within the area of effect.

Now it’s really important to note here that the bftp MUST be fired towards the player at least 1 degree. Firing from below will not activate the shield and will just waste your bftp.

The next thing I want to talk about is that flame shield is a “weak” shield. It’s not always been this way on arc2, so not everyone knows how to utilize it, but the duration that it deflects and the power it deflects can both be abused to get damage through. Take for example this lava bomb. Now the delection radius is large enough that the bomb radius does not overlap, but because the shield is weak, it will let it fall close enough before exploding to deal damage.

Let’s talk now about abusing the timing aspect of Flame Shield. Many spells can do this, however fragmentation bombs and spells that cast for a long time are the best. One example is deluge. Deluge casts at such a slow rate that flame shield will give up before it finishes.

Because the bomb aspect will deactivate the shield before exploding, bombs that generate projectiles will spawn such projectiles completely unaffected by flame shield. This is particularly useful with arcane bomb.

In addition to all this, the hitbox is not perfect, and because of the weakness of the shield, you can still place bombs in a spot that would be affected by the deflection.

Ok now something more practical and extremely important about Flame Shield is that arrows are able to ignore it. Something about the deflection cannot handle deflecting arrows that are roughly 45 degrees aimed towards the bottom of the player. It’s likely due to the shape of the hitbox neglecting it. This means Rain of Arrows is very simple to pull off with this trick.

While not as easily pulled off without some muscle memory with arrows, it can also be reliably done with arrows.I could have posted a better gif but this one is a good realistic gif. The more off-angle and off target you get, it will start to curve at the last second, and if you are an extreme amount away from the desired angle, it will probably curve soon enough to miss.

Lastly, something unique about flame shield is that it melts snow particles.
