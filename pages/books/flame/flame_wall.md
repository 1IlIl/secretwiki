## Flame Wall 


Flame wall has all the properties of Flame Shield, except it’s placed down and falls and has a very small “base” which if touched by a player explodes and deactivates the shield.

Something to note about Flame Wall is that it can be used offensively

This interaction between Flame Wall and player is always possible, which means you can use flame wall defensively, and use it later as a trap.

It can be devastating vs towers like Fortress or Den of Darknes as they cannot move away from it.

Something not always useful except when it is, is the knockback ability of flame wall. If you would not like to move them upwards, aim towards the side of their character and they will be knocked downward or sideways.

If you would like to knock them upward, you want to aim close to the center of their character. Now there’s a bit of a of conspiracy around whether to drop the wall from high up or just place it right on top of them, but as far as I can tell, there is no different. Regardless, there is a bit of jank to the knockback on this spell and it is not always reliable.

Something to note is that the target summoning circle of flame wall is one of the smallest in the game. This means it can fit in all kinds of places. This includes the side of Den of Darkness if you can’t reach the top, or within mud balls.

Something to mention about Flame Wall is that it is not a normal projectile when it is falling. It falls directly down and ignores all shields. This makes it THE flame spell for dealing with wind shield or static shield.

Something to know about Flame wall is that the AOE on the explosion between player and wall is very small, however what not everyone knows is that it is still large enough to hit multiple players or minions that are on top of eachother.
