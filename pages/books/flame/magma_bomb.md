## Magma Bomb 


Magma Bomb is one of the best spells of Book of Flame. It is an RNG based spell that can sometimes deal a ton of damage. Magma bomb, when it explodes, explosed for 25 damage and spawn 4 projectiles which each fly out and explode upon contacting a player or terrain.

These projectiles can hit the player or they can fan out. Something I will cover in another section of this wiki, but want to touch on here is that extending the magma bomb into the player will not ensure maximum damage. There is a mechanic that intentionally stops this strategy and so this is something to know.

While getting the bomb next to the player is the ultimate goal of the caster, there is definitely some strategy around where and how close you place the bomb. Due to the previous mechanic I mentioned, there is a certain duration that sub-projectiles phase through players immediately after being generated. This means that while you may not be able to “stuff” magma bomb, you can do what I have coined a “Magma Flash” in which you stuff the bomb right at the edge of the opponent such that the center of it is not within the opponent. This can lead to some more effective bomb stuffing.

This mechanic also means that placing a bomb directly on someone’s head is about as RNG as placing it half a player length away, so this is something to consider.

Another thing to consider is that players are not quite perfectly round. The top and side of a player are very strict to bombs and so they will always be exactly edge to edge between bomb and player.

If you instead put a bomb onto the corner of a player, the player’s edge is more “fuzzy”, and so you increase the odds on the projectiles that spawn to hit the player compared to firing away from the player.

Finally, something you probably realized is that magma bomb bounces players around quite a bit. This is partly due to the spell's knockback, but also partly due to the bomb having many sub-projectiles. Each projectile applies its knockback additively and so you can end up knocking players very far if multiple projectiles land directly.
