## Napalm 

Napalm is a spell on arcanists which launches a bunch of projectiles in bolt form. This means they come out one after another.. Something to note is that unlike arcanists 1, Arcanists 2s’ Napalm is very natural, so the spread is not very useful if you would like to land a bunch on top of a player’s head.

Napalm, like many bolts pells, will stop early if a projectile hits the caster.

It should be noted that when napalm hits an opponent, it can create a terrain cutout larger than the player and knock the player around, which will make it hard to land all shots.

Aiming to hit all shots can be a bit difficult, but the simple answer is just to aim a bit below center.. Aiming towards the top of the player can knock them towards you and out of the attack.

Aiming low will knock them up and back, which can be very useful in certain situations, however not useful for reliably dealing full napalm damage.

While this chaos doesn’t always deal max damage, it can however be useful for manipulating the opponent’s position in a way very few spells in arcanists can do.

It should also be mentioned that napalm is extremely powerful due to the fact that it can deal most of it’s damage through small terrain barriers.

In addition to this, napalm can also deal a large amount of damage to towers that do not have much health left.

Similarly to towers, it can also be used to apply knockback to flighted units while deflighting.

Something to note is that napalm has a relatively small damage aoe despite the large terrain cutout. Flame players often deal with opponents boxing them in, however with a bit of knowledge, you can easily handle these close quarters fights.

There’s also a trick for hitting cog tower from the top. Because cog mobile is asymmetrical, you will have a lot more luck from the right side. I can’t really explain how you will get into a situation when you need this, but you will if you play Flame enough.

Something to note is that the fact that napalm stops after hitting yourself can make it one of the few spell you might want to hit yourself with to clear entangle. Simply aim it at something nearby and it will deal 5 damage.

Something more fun oriented now is that napalm, due to applicative knockback, will knock the player significantly far if there are multiple napalms nearby. It also appears that this knockback can be significant if the player is already falling from napalm once.This is NOT because of any inherent property of napalm or the player, but instead because hitting the earlier napalm causes the AOE to drop the rest of the napalm into tighter piles.
