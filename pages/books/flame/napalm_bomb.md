## Napalm Bomb 


Napalm Bomb is a bomb spell that deals 25 damage and spawns 15 napalms in a uniform circle.

Like most fragmenting bombs, stuffing napalm bomb is not all that effective.

It’s so ass. There’s a few uses where it’s not a complete waste of a spell. One of those is between towers and terrain.There’s not really much else you can do with this spell. It’s just bad.Since the Brine Bomb buff, this is probably the worst bomb in the game; worse than lava bomb.

The only other thing I can think of is that napalm bomb can be very useful is the very situational time that there is a phantom or apparition that you would like to deny or make more difficult. Napalm bomb can create a uniform distribution of napalm that can make these spells difficult to manuver around.
