## Rain of Arrows 


Rain of Arrows, commonly referred to as ROA or roa is an aerial that spawns 5 15 damage arrows from the top of the map.You typically want to aim for around the top corner of a player to deal the full damage.

The arrows from ROA spawn in a somewhat flatter orientation above the map and curve inward towards the place that you set the target much like any other arrow.Past the target, they fan back out. This can be used to get a Rain of Fire type outcome from the spell.

Hitting flying targets with roa can prove to be quite tricky due to the knockback moving the player, however there are tricks to lining up the perfect roa. The trick to hitting multiple projectiles with roa is making sure they hit the exact top of the player target. These methods have been patched out previously and an RNG element has been added to the arrows, however there is still at least one somewhat reliable method. Aim such that the target’s far edge is about even with the far side of the player compared to where the arrows spawn. I don’t believe this can be perfectly reliable, but it will almost always hit 4/5 projectiles.

Much like ROF, ROA also has a unique interaction to being aimed as high as possible. Not only do the projectiles spawn in the opposite orientation, they will sort of plume upwards until curving and eventually falling back down.

ROA actually has quite a bit of knockback, which can make it a very powerful knockback tool. One way to use this is to aim behind a player.

Another trick is to aim for an already hit tower. This can take some getting used to as you need to know where the player spawns from when it leaves certain towers, but it can be extremely useful.

Something else that is very useful is what ROA does when it interacts with shields. Like you saw if you read the flame shield section, ROA can ignore flame shield if aimed correctly.

While ROA is less effective towards Wind Shield, using this same trick can get you at least a little bit of damage versus some targets. Sometimes that is all you need.
