## Rain of Fire 


Rain of Fire, commonly referred to as ROF or rof is an aerial attack which spawns 5 25 damage fire balls with very small AOE and very little knockback. These are equally spaced apart, and much like many aerials, the direction they spawn in corresponds to what direction you are facing when you cast it.

Rain of Fire spawns at a relatively low enough angle that it can be used to damage players on the side of grassy.

The spacing on these shots does not work very well for many targets, however it can work if you aim at the tops of towers.

Pegasus is also about the perfect size to be hit for 50 on.

There’s no simple line up to pull off the next trick, however something you can do depending on positioning is knock players with the first fire ball into the other fireballs.

Sometimes people like to set up their nature’s wrath right next to them and hop in their sanctuary. Something interesting about this is one of the ways to best maximize rof. Simple aim roughly such that half the fireballs get wrathed and half do not, and they will join in the middle.

Rain of Fire, like some aerials, do weird things when aimed at the maximum height zoomed out. When aimed this way, Rain of Fire launched upward and in the opposite direction that you are facing.
