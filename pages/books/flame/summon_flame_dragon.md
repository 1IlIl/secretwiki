Something unique about Flame Dragon is that it is immune to Napalm Damage. This means it will take 0 damage from napalm and can fly into napalm at will without being stunned.This ability can be useful for breaking terrain.

While it may seem like this makes it immune to it’s own attack, it is important to note that the explosion from the breath attack is not napalm damage and will hurt it.

While most people know that Flame Dragon is immune to napalm, not many know that Flame Dragon is also immune to the explosion from touching Flame Wall.

Flame dragon is a fairly large minion, and as such it can be somewhat easy to trap. Something to consider is that the radius is so large that a single mud ball will not block the dragon alone, so make sure not to give the opponent the other side of the trap!

Something to watch out for is that Flame Dragon is a minion which has the auto mounting mechanic. This means that if you summon it above you, it will automatically put you on the dragon. This can be useful, but can also be very bad for you.

Something else to note with Dragon is while you are on it, you won't be able to cast direct spells without the use of the following trick. Casting spells while on a mount is difficult because the mount will act as a solid object, and “catch” the projectile from where it was casted. The way to get around this is to use Extend. Extend moves the origin of the projectile away from the caster, such that on a dragon we can extend off the close corner and fire spells that way.
