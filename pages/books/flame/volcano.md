## Volcano


Volcano is an incredibly powerful spell. You target a spot on the map, and the Volcano erupts that initial turn as well as 4 turns after.

While it may seem random, what comes out fo cano is not, at least not in content. It does not matter so much with subsequent turns, so I will not take the time to determine every single turn. The first turn however is fairly simple 4 fire balls get launched as well as one napalm bomb.

While Volcano would seem ideal for turtling opponents at the bottom of the map. Consider that the terrain generation happens soon enough that Volcano will rarely sink an enemy. This matters because in order to deal damage through tower, the tower itself must sink. With Volcano the tower will rarely sink, meaning that the only damage that can be done on the first turn of a volcano can sometimes be only what was done by the napalm bomb

Something on the flip side is when Volcanodoes sink the tower. Often times this will happen when the player is roughly a fireball radius from the bottom of the map.

While it is simple to just think about the initial damage, Volcano is immensely powerful in it’s ability to turn the map into a wasteland. It is important to keep this in mind both in in defending yourself as well as perhaps setting up an opening that your opponent did not expect.

Something to note is that Nature’s Wrath may be used by your opponent to manipulate your Volcano.

The other spell to worry about is Vortex. Vortex has two modes, pull and push, but both are capable of redirecting Volcano.

Similarly , magical barrier is a spell that the opponent might consider. What is important to note here is that all the napalms that would spawn from napalm bombs count towards that 50 projectile cap, making magical barrier last only about one turn.

Something to remember is that volcano can be cast when outside the map border. This is not often useful, but don’t forget as it can come in handy.

Finally, while I don’t cover strategy in large on these kinds of pages, something to keep in mind when casting Volcano is whether or not you have ROA off cooldown. It is very wise to hold on to cano for the right moment, and having that ROA to chase can come very much in handy.
