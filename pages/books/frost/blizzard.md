## Blizzard 


Blizzard is a somewhat powerful aerial spell which spawns a large amount of snow onto the battlefield from above.

This snow can be very useful for healing frost minions, however watch out that it may trap your minions as well.

Blizzard works best against larger minions like pegasus, dealing upwards of 100 damage based on RNG.

Blizzard above the map can deflect projectiles. This does not act like a shield, meaning that it cannot be deactivated if you bftp it first. This effect most often messes up Deluge.

There is a certain threshold on maps in which snow can no longer build up. This means the top of the map is relatively impossible to block with Blizzard.
