## Comet


Comet is a Aerial spell which spawns a large projectile, exploding for 50 damage and creating a large crater as soon as it makes contact with anything, and shooting out many sub projectiles, which explode and spawn ice balls.These projectiles have a large phasing time, meaning they are extremely unreliable, especially versus flighted opponents.

A lot of these projectiles will go upward, meaning if you can get a comet to explode under an opponent, you have a higher likelihood of dealing extra damage. The same does even for if you can get it to explode next to a player rather than on top of them.

In the past there have been tricks to aim Comet such that it would reliably deal 200 damage, however they have since been removed. I am sure there are still more optimal tricks to be learned in the modern times, however I di not yet know them.
