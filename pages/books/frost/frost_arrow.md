## Frost Arrow 


Frost arrow is a pretty cool arrow spell with a rather high damage figure, but limited uses.

While frost arrow may not always deal this same 100 damage figure, regardless of how the spell works, I will explain how to maximize the damage. When Frost Arrow Explodes, it explodes into a number of particles that rain all over. There is a few options for maximizing this damage. One of them being going from above/behind the player onto their close side.

The other angle I think works well is flatter angler but over top towards their far side.

Something else to note about Frost Arrow is that it deals a quite large mount of knockback. This can make it very useful and or scary on turn 1.
