## Frost Shards


Frost Shards is a bolt spell in arcanist 2. This spell launcheds 15 5 damage projectiles. Despite the unique particle/projectile, this does not have any kind of frost damage, meaning it wonâ€™t heal frost minions.

While there is not that much knockback to this spell, it can sometimes still pose an issue, so just make sure to aim for the top of the player and in most cases this will work fine. Just be conscious of the opponent's situation and what a tiny bit of knockback might do.

The only real trick to shards is that you can hit quite close targets with it.

Much like a trick I showed for napalm, you can use this trick to get detower at very close locations.
