## Ice Ball 


Ice Ball is a ball spell which upon exploding, deals 25 damage and creates 10 ice balls which do 5 frost damage each. This frost damage heals frost minions and the tower.

While the ice balls have healing properties towards frost minions, the explosion itself does not. This means if you are trying to heal with this spell, try to blow up the ball above the target. If you’re not careful, you can endu p dealing more damage to the minion than you heal.

Ice ball can deal up to 75 damage to targets, however it can be a bit difficult. There’s an odd upward knockback that can create some odd outcomes.
