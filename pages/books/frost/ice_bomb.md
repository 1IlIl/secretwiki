## Ice Bomb


Ice bomb is much like a baby between magma bomb and ice ball. It has a bit of the jank knockback like youâ€™d expect, but a high damage ceiling.It should be noted that this bomb explodes into a bunch of sub-projectiles, that explode into ice balls. There is a certain portion of this damage that is frost damage, and will heal frost minions.

The anti-stuff protection on ice bomb seems to be more aggresive than most other bombs. This means that the projectile phase a lot longer than other fragmentation bombs. This means that often times placing ice bomb directly on top of the player is worse than next to the player.

Similar to magma bomb, the corners of the player seem to be most reliable, however ice bomb is incredibly rng.

There are some setups for ice bomb, such as vine bridge and ice shield, or even both of them together.
