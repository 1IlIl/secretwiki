Ice Castle can be placed pretty close to players, making it fairly versatile.

Something very powerful about Ice castle is that is floats on water, making it resilient to sinking as well as the damage through tower mechanics which rely on sinking. It does however cost 5hp to float each time it needs to generate the ice.
