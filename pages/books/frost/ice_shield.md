## Ice Shield


Ice Shield generates a shield outside the player and does not end turn.

Terrain does block this shield, so if you would like to maximize the land creation, you will want to be in the air.

Minion also block the shield, which has pros and cons. Something useful is that you can use minions to create ways for you to get out of the ice shield. Something to note is that ice shield will only spawn balls where it precalculates the locations.These balls are prevented if anything is in contact with their precalculated location.

Ice shield always spawns at the same radius, so there is some tricks to predicting where it will spawn distance wise using different tricks, however it’s best to just learn by feel for the most part. One trick though is that the overhead icon’s bottom is learly directly on the inner radius of ice shield.

There will be an entire section on this mechanic, but just ot mention it here, ice shield is one of the manufactured terrains that is very easy to get out of with mounting mechanics.

As Ice Shield doesn’t use the turn, you might want to be knowledgable on how to get out of it using bftp, another spell that does not end turns.There is a couple reliable ways to do it. One is to aim between two ice balls. This will often work.

The other method of bftping is to extend the bftp through the shield partially, such that the bftp explodes within an ice ball

Be careful though that you do not extend through the ice shield. This can be avoided by using the more 90 degree-centric angles.

Another thing you might want to do is flash through ice shield. This can be a bit tricky, however it is possible.Opening up more interesting angles can be done by bftping the person to an edge first, however it’s almost completely unnecessary in this sort of position.
