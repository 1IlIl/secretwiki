## Snow Ball


Snow Ball is a ball spell that has a pretty unique explosion, or lack therof.

While Snowball doesn’t have much of an explosion, it does have quite a few unique trailes. One is that it spawns about 50 sub-projectiles which are snow particles. Each deals 2 damage and if they miss the player, they create terrain.

Snowball has a limiting factor in that it cannot fly indefinitely. After a couple seconds, it automatically transforms into the snow itself.

In the past snowball was sort of interesting, in that it did actually more than it’s tooltip in certain cases. As far as I know this has changed, however you can do the entire 100 reliably versus large minions like pegasus.

Versus Smaller minions it is not the most reliable spell, however if you aim towards the corner diagonally downward, you will get the best results.

Something to note is that this snow is melted by flame shield and flame wall.

Something that’s a bit difficult to explain is why snowball is generally not “spammable”. If you use snowball multiple times in a row, you will notice it does less damage over time. This is due to terrain building up, and the snow sticking to the terrain rather than dealing damage to the player.
