## Summon Frost Giant


Frost Giant is a very powerful minion with modest mobility and a large kit of spells. It is 100 hp, and much like all other Frost minions, it heals from snow. Something unique however to Frost Giant is that it has a weaker form of blizzard that is auto cast above it at the beginning of your turn. This can be useful both for healing the giant as well as damaging other minions and players. In addition to this is generates terrain.

Again like other Frost minions, it can walk on water for a 5 hp penalty for each ice land it generates.

Frost Giant has quite a few spells , One is “Smash”. Smash is a 30 damage melee spell which has high knockback and not much terrain destruction.

The next spell to cover is Ice Bomb. Frost Giant gets Ice Bomb as long as you bring it in your spellbook. It also shares the uses of it, meaning you can only use it twice regardless of if you cast it yourself or on the minion.

The final spell Frost Giant gets is Snow Ball. As long as you bring it in your book, Frost Giant will have it. It’s a very powerful spell, so be sure it include this one if you bring frost giant.

Finally, I mentioned it slightly earlier, but Frost Giant can and will trap itself if you forget about it. Make sure you keep this in mind.

It’s also important to note that this mini form of blizzard does NOT deflect projectiles.
