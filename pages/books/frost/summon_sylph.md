Sylph has two spells, One of which is ice shield. This ice shield shares a cooldown with the player, however it creates the ice shield around the sylph instead.

Sylph’s other spell is Sylph Arrow. Sylph arrow is a rather unique arrow spell which is fired at a fixed power. Sylph Arrow is also split into three projectiles. Sylph Arrow deals up to 60 damage, however it’s rather unreliable as it explodes into projectiles much like frost arrow.
