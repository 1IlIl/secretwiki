## Entangle


Entangle is a spell which takes the majority of movement away from a player. A player who is entangled can only tiny hop or walk.

Entangle can only effect a single target; it does not have any AOE. This means you cannot aim it between targets to hit both.

Entangle can destroy a very small ammount of terrain, but only if it does not hit a target. Entangle destroys almost no terrain if it hits a player.

Entangle disrupts effects like Flight, preventing the player from flying.

Entangle also effects towers like floating castle and MACAIR. It's imprtant to note that the action of towering does not remove entangle from the player either.

Finally, and probably most importantly, entangle disables spells like arcane gate and santa's magic.
