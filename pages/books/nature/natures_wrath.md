## Nature's Wrath


Nature's wrath is a large spell which is kind of like a shield. It has a "base" which falls until it hits terrain or the bottom of the map, and deflects projectiles and players trying to pass above it.

Walking below the wrath does not effect movement at all.

Walking is not effected by nature's wrath.

Wrath pushing up and out on projectiles, but it's not infinately effective. A strongly thrown spell that is mostly downward will not be deflected too far from it's trajectory.

Wrath just got changed ,so there's probably all sorts of tricks to learn still, however to cover some of the already established ones I will start with gliding through wrath. You can glide through wrath given enough run-up.

You can simply jump through wrath if you have enough height.
