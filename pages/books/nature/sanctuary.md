## Sanctuary 


Sanctuary is a 75 hp tower which has a bubble around it which can clear shields and auras.

Sanctuary is rather large, it clears a lot of terrain when it is cast. This effect can be significantly valuable to a player choosing which tower to bring.

It's also important to note that sanctuary is a very tall tower, and it's player location is about twice as high as other towers. This effects the origin of the spells youabout twice as high as other towers. This effects the origin of the spells you cast.

I glossed over Sanctuary's ability to remove shields and auras, but let's define this a bit. It can clear shield effects like flame shield, wind shield, invulnerability shield, and dark defences.

Sanctuary can clear most OG arcanist effects like entangle, aura of decay, and thorns.


It's important to note that even if aura of decay is cast in a way that hits the sanctuary, the sanctuary is immune to the damage. This is the same for popping thorns that are on the ground around it.

It cannot remove things like gravity, glide , bleed, or flame wall.
