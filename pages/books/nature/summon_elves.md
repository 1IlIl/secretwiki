Each elf has two spells. One is Volley and the other is Flurry.


Volley is a spell which puts down a "target" if one does not already exist. If one already exists, then flurry moves it.

During the start of a players turn, if there is a Volley target out, that players elves will fire an arrow(or arrows w/ familiar)

The arrows cannot hurt the elf that cast them, there is no self damage, however they can deal damage to other elves or their player.

The volley target can move in the form of terrain destruction, and will never go away after cast unless it falls off the map into the water.

Your teamate or opponent can also put down volley targets, so watch out for that!
