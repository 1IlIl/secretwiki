A thorn ball which has stuck to terrain will explode if the terrain it sits on is blown up by most sources.

Alternatively, casting the spell Nature's Wrath will blow up each thorn that is currently on the map.

Thorns do not apply a lot of knockback to the target; usually not moving them at all.

Thorns that explode after they are put down deal half their normal damage. This means that the max damage that a thorn on the ground can deal is 25.

In addition to this, if you would like to deal self damage for some reason, be aware that a using a thorn towards the ground will not trigger it to explode, you can however lob it a bit upward into yourself and deal the aoe.
