## Vine Bridge


Vine bridge is a spell which generates terrain for the caster to walk on. It's aimed using the bolt aim and has a limited range that it can target. Vine bridge places flowers and vines in a concave arc between caster and target.

You can determine if vine bridge is a valid or invalid range based on the highlighting on the curser. A dim cursor means invalid target or otherwise too far. A bright curser means you can cast.

Beware that the source of the vine bridge is often times the bottom of the player, so what you expect might not be exactly what happens.

One important restriction to keep an eye out for is that vine bridge may not be used during flight. Make sure if you want to vine bridge something and also cast flight that you do the vine bridge first.
