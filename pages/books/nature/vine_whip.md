## Vine Whip


Vine whip is composed of a number of small explosions and finally a larger explosion at the end of the whip.

Vine Whip is primarily a spell for knocking players around. each small explosion has considerable knockback, however the final large explosion has the most knockback out of the components of the spell.

Something to look out for is that the small explosions that lead to the large explosions happen with a slight delay between them , so each small explosion can push the target away from the direction that you intend for them to go. You can either lean into this by aiming off center of the player, or you can try and shoot straight by aiming close to their center.

There is a certian strategy with whip called "reverse whip" that some very seasoned might attribute with a VERY old arcanists 2 player named iyagami, but I will talk about it mostly in terms of techniques taught by the arcanists DougDimmadome.

There's two main methods of setup to do this technique, but before we get to this, it must be stated that there must be solid terrain below the opponent, or else the smaller explosions may mess up the location of the player. One way to ensure this is to use a spell like vine bridge beneath them before casting flight.


The first setup is to stand directly on top of the player and cast flight. This will raise the player a certain bit above the opponent. After this you simply must fly upward once and then cast whip.

The other method in which the setup can be performed is to start corner to corner with the player. Then complete 7 movements alternative between up and down starting with an upward movement.
