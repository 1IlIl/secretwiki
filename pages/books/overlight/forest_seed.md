## Forest Seed 


Forest Seed(aka tree) is a targeted Land Creation spell which spawns living terrain. Forest Seed spawns with 75 health and as long as it has health, it ‘s contained terrain cannot be destroyed.

Forest Seed Loses 15 HP per turn and after 5 turns it will turn into terrain regardless of player interaction.Something to watch out for is sphere of healing. While it may seem smart to heal yourself while you are trapped and wait out the tree death, sphere of healing and all healing spells for that matter can heal tree, prolonging it’s life.

Because Forest Seed has health, it can also be drained.

Forest Seed Falls when it is summoned, but it also falls as long as it retains health after taking damage.

There’s quite a few tricks with Forest Seed. The most Important ones are getting in and out using blast from the past.The most basic method is getting out and just using the second up-rightward extended angle, then alternating high and long jumping until you are out. It’s important to note that in almost all cases you will exit on a long jump, making this dangerous in certain circumstances.

The other method of getting out with bftp is to bftp downward. This angle is the 4th from the bottom.

The only other bftp to know is bftping in from outside. This can only be done using the following trick. Bftping from the top is not possible no matter how close it looks. The angle to get into tree is 6th from the top. Just remember , 2 - 4 - 6, from most common to least common.

There’s other tricks to be done with Forest seed as well. One of them is to utilize the fact that forest seed allows certain projectiles to pass through it .One of these is chain lightning.

There’s also a trick to getting out of tree using a swarm. It’s less common as swarm was enlarged in a patch, however given room, this trick still works. How this trick works is you summon swarm, and because you are technically on top of the tree, the aura stacking mechanic along with the turn switching guarantees that the tree will be dead on your turn.

While Forest Seed has gone out of style a bit as far as opening moves go due to it being given a turn 2-3 initial cooldown, it’s still important to know how to flash out of a tree. It’s fairly obvious that this trick just requires the use of extend.

Something sort of odd about Forest seed is it’s collision when falling. There is a zone where you can phase into the tree a bit if you are within it while it’s falling.It’s not possible to get in otherwise, but if you put yourself into this position, your opponent can “lock you in” with a minion, so it’s important to watch out for.

Finally, as Forest Seed is somewhat creature-like it can actually be used to stack auras. It’s location is a bit wonky, as you need to imagine you need to be be near the center of it’s entire art, and the circle extends by quite a bit, meaning it hits about a player length below the tree rather than directly below the tree.
