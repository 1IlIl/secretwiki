Invulnerability Shield is a Shield Spell in Arcanists 2 which protects from all damage dealt to the caster.

Invulnerability Shield is dispelled as soon as the player casts a spell. The way that you play with such a shield is by having a minion to use spells on enemies instead. Casting a spell on a minion will not break invulnerability Shield.

Somestimes the Armageddon is a lot like casting spells on a minion, which means you will want to simply pass the turn. It’s important to remember that you do not need to wait out the timer to pass your turn. You can simply press ‘q’.

It’s important to note that things that would normally stun you due to damage will not stun you while you have invulnerability shield active.
