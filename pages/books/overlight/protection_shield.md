## Protection Shield


Protection shield applies a shield to the player, which absorbs 50 damage before damage will hit the player.

Protection shield can be useful when taking damage would remove an effect, such as flight or a tower.

Protection shield can be cast multiple times with an additive effect. Protection shield in a lot of ways is effective health, so it’s a great spell to cast when you have nothing else useful to cast in on a turn.

While Protection Shield seems amazing, there is at least one counter to it. The first to talk about is Sanctuary. Sanctuary’s bubble will remove Protection Shield from a player. If a player has multiple protection shields on, this means that all those turns will be wasted.This also applies to the caster of Sanctuary.

Another tower interaction to worry about is the damage multiplication from pebbles. This effect will force protection shield to absorb twice the damage(as pebbles does double damage to towers), making Protection Shield foolish while in towers.

Another interesting interaction is Entangle. Entangle is a spell which limits the player movement. If you are entangled, you must remove all the prot that you have currently before the entangle is broken.

What happens if you protection shield after is that you only near to clear an amount of protection shield equal to what you had at the start before the entangle breaks.This means if you were entangled at 0, and you protection shield, you need only take 1 damage to break the entangle, which is sort of the opposite of what you would expect considering flight works the opposite way.

While Aura of Decay will stun most creatures,the exceptions to this are undead minions and minions with a protection shield that was applied after the turn that the aura of decay was cast.

Something to note is that having prot is not enough to prevent the stun. If you have a protection shield that was applied first, then the aura will still stun you.
