## Rising Star


Rising Star is an aerial spell in Arcanists 2 centered around Light Damage. Targeting it will spawn a bright white glow above the map which will rain down shining bolts.

On the first turn you cast it, it spawns a single Shining Bolt. On the second turn, it spawns two. Third turn three, Fourth four, and finally on the last turn it spawns a huge shining bolt which deals 125 damage. While all the Shining Bolts generally get launched in a random direction, the final one always falls directly straight down. As this deals light damage, this final shining bolt can one-shot a lich.

Something to note is that these falling shining bolts, all of them, can be affected by shields or other mechanics which deflect spells. This means it can become very dangerous for the caster.
