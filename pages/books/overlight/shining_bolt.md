## Shining Bolt


Shining Bolt is a Ball Spell with unique projectile kinematics. It deals a odd maximum of 45 damage and tends to be pretty “floaty” It travels and falls as a slower rate than other projectiles. This means it often requires less power to travel as far as other projectiles.

It’s not a particularly interesting or powerful spell, however as it does light damage, it deals up to 90 damage to undead targets.
