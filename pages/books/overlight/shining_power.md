## Shining Power 


Shining Power is a transformation spell in Arcanists 2. It turns you into an angel, giving you passive healing of 10HP per turn, limiting your spells to Overlight or Arcane, and letting you fly in a way unique to Shining Power.

Shining Power’s flight is unique in that if the player takes damage to health, rather than falling down after taking the knockback, the player instead takes the knockback from where they were, usually falling sideways even if the knockback was not in that direction. If the attack only removes protection shield, then the player will stay where they were.

Also unique to this form of flight is it’s ability to resist dismounting. If you are on a minion, and are flashed, you will not fall off with shining power.
