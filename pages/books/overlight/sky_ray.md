## Sky Ray


Sky Ray is an aerial spell which comes down from the top of the map, directly to where you target, and then creates an explosion of light damage.

While it may be obvious, it is important to understand that any terrain or minion above the target will be hit instead of where you target.It explodes at the highest terrain above the specific X coordinate you target.

The explosion on Sky Ray is pretty large. In addition to this the knockback is significant and because you can so precisely aim it, it can come in handy for sinking opponents.

Sky Ray is not a projectile, so if an opponent has a shield or there is a static ball around, sky ray will ignore them.

While Sky ray may seem pixel perfect, it’s not quite. There’s some small unit of width to the targeting, such that you can't trust your targeting absolutely.

You have to aim about this(see below gif) far away before it starts passing the player. You can maybe use the targeter for reference, leaving no more than about a quarter of the inner circle inside the player.If you want to be sure, make sure the entire inner circle contains none of the target.

Something Interesting about Sky Ray is that it has a minimum damage amount. Rather than targets further and further from the center of the explosion taking less and less damage all the way to 0, if you are hit by Sky Ray, you take AT LEAST 25 damage. Oftentimes it’s difficult to even achiev this little, targets all the way to the edge of the AOE taking upwards of 30.

Finally, as this spell deals light damage, it deals double damage to undead targets.
