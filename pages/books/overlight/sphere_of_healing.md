## Sphere of Healing


Sphere of healing is a healing ball spell with low knockback which heals 25HP and can be used on players and creatures.

Much like Shining Bolt, Sphere of healing has an odd projectile kinematics equation, seeming slightly more floaty.

While it heals living creatures and players, it hurts undead creatures and players and deals damage equal to twice the heal amount. In addition to this, the knockback against undead creatures is increased by quite a bit.
