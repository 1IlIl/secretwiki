## Summon Paladin 


Paladin is a sword fighter minion in Arcanists 2. It is 100HP, lacks mobility, and unlike Dark Knight is NOT heavy.

While it can have up to 4 spells, it inherently has a spell called “Sunder”. This is a 75 Damage melee attack which can knock people far, but is NOT Light damage. This attack does not deal double damage to undead targets, however it is unable to deal damage to friendly creatures.

While it’s intended to be used while on a pegasus, remember Paladin is not resistant to knockback.

Given the player has them, paladin also has Protection Shield, Summon Pegasus, and Sphere of Healing. Protection shield, like pegasus, does not have a cooldown, but Summon Pegasus, like most minions spells, shares a cooldown with the player.

Something to look out for is that while Paladin(Pally) doesn’t have much jump, if it is jumping off a pegasus, it has significantly more jump.

Finally, While I don’t often cover the zombie versions of minions within the book, I want to make a specific mention for Paladin , which is that paladin’s zombie form functions much more closely to Dark Knight than to paladin, gaining Charge and Drain Bolt.
