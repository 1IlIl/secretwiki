## Summon Pegasus 


Pegasus is an incredibly important minion in Arcanists 2. It’s a large flying minon with 100HP and which can be ridden.

Pegasus gets Protection shield as it’s only spell, given the caster brings it. The unique thing about the pegasus’s version is that it has no cooldown, allowing you to cast protection shield on it multiple times in a row.

Similarly to other flying mountable minions, you can use extend to fire spells while mounted, meaning you have relatively limited angles to attack while mounted.

I will touch on this briefly(more in another section of the wiki), but there is a mechanic for mounting through small bits of terrain most often referred to with pegasus. To put it simply, put the pegasus above the terrain, jump, and you will mount through the terrain as long as it is thin enough.

The other thing that I will mention briefly(again in another section of the wiki) is automounting. This can be done by spawning the mountable minion very close above the player.

Finally, again in another section of my guide, I know it’s getting old… dismounting pegasus can happen in a lot of interesting ways, but always upwards. To walk on “top” of a pegasus, you can put something above it such that you dismount while not “gaining air”.

One last thing….yes same thing again, The mounting of the player, this is a little bit complicated, but something important to know is that mounting is easiest if the pegasus moves. As long as the pegasus collides with the player ,it will mount the player. This can be useful for when you cannot freely jump around the pegasus.
