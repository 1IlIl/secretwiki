## Summon Pixies


Pixies are a small minion that spawns with 25HP and can be very useful as things to jump on top of to get around, or block opponents and their minions.

One of the common uses for pixies is draining them for health. Hitting all 3 will heal you 75 HP.

Pixies have the Fairy Ring spell as well as Sphere of Healing. Fairy Ring can be useful as it can be used to move minions across terrain.

Fairy ring destroys a bit of terrain at the location that the minion is summoned to, meaning it can be used for offensive terrain destruction as well. It does not create a knockback, making it very reliable.

Finally, Itâ€™s important to note that fairy ring can move multiple minion given they are close enough to the cast target.
