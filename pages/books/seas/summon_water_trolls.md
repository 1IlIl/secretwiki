The hydration spell can transform water trolls into larger versions. This resets the trolls health , increases their size, and increases their max HP.The medium size troll has a 15 damage melee attack and the large troll has a 30 damage melee attack.

The heads on the trolls signify if they have used up their 1 melee attack for the turn. A bobbing head means the troll still can deal damage, and a still head means that the troll is safe to go near.
