## Fissure 


Fissure is a two part spell. The first part is after initially casting it, a few scatter rocks come from the bottom of the map upwards. After your opponent(s) pass the turn back to you, the second part happens, which is an absolute meteor-ton of scatter rocks are fired upwards at mid to high power. Demolishing the map above.

Something to note is that this spell’s initial damage is very high, however it only reaches a certain distance. Due to tower sinking mechanics, if you take a lot of damage and sink while in a tower above the bottom of the map, any damage above your tower’s health will be dealt to you, making this a very scary spell for bottom dwellers.

Often times you want to remove a player’s ability to gate away and then put this under them, however there’s so many spells that interact with fissure, so it’s good to go over some of the interactions.First and simplest is wind shield. Wind shield works.

Something that won’t work is Magical Barrier. This comes back to the fact that magical barrier has a 50 projectile limit and each pebble from each scatter rock counts towards that.

Not exactly usable in the same way, wrath can sometimes make fissure very dangerous for the caster, redirecting the fissure where the wrath player wants.Vertex is similar in a way, however I won’t demonstrat that one.

Static ball and shield are also ways to completely negate Fissure.

Listen… Sometimes the map is just tall enough where it doesn’t work…
