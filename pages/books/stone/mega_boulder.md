## Mega Boulder


Mega Boulder is another very popular spell from stone which returning players don’t always understand. Mega boulder is a bit different in arcanists 2, not using any height based mechanic for increasing damage.

Mega boulder has two phases as a projectile. The first phase is smaller, and in this form mega boulder will bounce off players and terrain and deal no damage.

The Second phase, which is after mega boulder has been in the air for roughly 2 seconds is the damaging phase. In this phase, anything making contact with the mega boulder will take damage. This damage is unique in that there is a mechanism of sorts that reduces the damage this spell deals if stuffin into an opponent.Normally, the spell can do up to 132 damage, however stuffed into the opponent can do as low as 100 and more regularly 102.

If you’re asking me how it works I wish I knew… I am too lazy to reverse engineer it. It’s almost solely due to bomb stuffing mechanic afaik. Something cool about Mega boulder is that it fits through portal.

Something equally important to note is that it only fits in the first form.

Earlier I mentioned that it deals damage specifically to the bottom half. This is important because it can be possible to extend boulder so far down that it will fall through the opponent when stuffed.

To get a bit more into the bounce mechanics. The bounces will usually bounce horizontally in the opposite direction that they landed, however there’s a bit of nuance based on the angle of the terrain/player that they hit. Thinking simple though, this means it’s usually best to aim past the player.

Something else to note is that if you get the mega boulder to “explode” on the player, it often doesn’t bounce away from them.

Now the final tip I will give is that you can minimize the horizontal angle that might cause the mega boulder to bounce away by launching it very high. This height inherently reduces the angle ti will bounce at, ensuring that if it lands on the player, that it will stay on the player.

Oh, I almost forgot. There is a slight effect that this transformation has on the projectile.It adds a bit of drag to the spell, making it fall slightly short of where a ball spell normally would.
