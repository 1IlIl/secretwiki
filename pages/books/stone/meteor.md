## Meteor


Meteor is a destructive lv3 spell from Book of Stone. It spawns a ton of pebbles and rips through terrain itself as well.

Meteor might not always be the most damaging spell, but it is fairly effective versus towers.Fortress’s damage reduction to per-projectile spells negates this, however other towers take a ton of damage from this spell.

It looks like a weak spell? Well no, but well ok yes it stocks. Some ways to increase it’s potency are to use it for other goals. One such goal is to fling players around. Meteor is fairly good at this.

Oh… that doesn’t look that useful either? Ok you can increase the knockback if the player is mounted. That’s got to be enough for you?

Yeah it’s just an ass spell. Ok onto tricks. There’s one. Players inside live trees tend to take quite a bit of damage from meteor. It’s still not very strong, but it’s using it to the best of it’s abilities.
