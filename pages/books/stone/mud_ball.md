## Mud Ball 


Mud Ball is an incredibly useful spell, and for many reasons that I will not discuss here. I will however do the usual and show you everything you might see while playing with or against it.Mud ball at itâ€™s core is a spell that traps a player in terrain generated by it.

Something minute to notice is that very rarely are you trapped tightly. This can allow for a little bit of movement, and in some cases this can be very important.

Something to note is that there is a bit of jankness to these floating pebble graphics. They sometimes allow you to jump into them with a spam of high jumps.This trick usually requires the pebble to be horizontal with you and for you to have enough froom to jump and bounce off the roof in front of it. You never know when something like this will come in handy.

Something to consider if you are playing with a lot of mud ballers is to flight against the top of the 4map. This can allow you to sometimes jump out of the mud. Sometimes you can long jump and avolid map damage as well.

Something else to note is that hitting an opponent is not equivalent at every angle. The spawn of the mud graphics center where it explodes, making hitting the outer edge of an opponent in relation to the terrain they are standing on make more mud for them to claw out of. On the opposite side , if you hit too far from an opponent, you may still deal full damage, but completely miss at tapping them.

Something not quite always useful, but can sometimes work is mounting pegasus out of mud ball.There is an entire section around this trick, but the simple of it is just high jump.

Something to keep in mind as well is that you can use BFTP to close the gap such that this trick works.
