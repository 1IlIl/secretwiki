Like most bolts it can be used closer than you might think.

If you use this on a 75 damage tower, it detowers in the first 8 pebbles, leaving two extra pebbles to hit your opponent. This can be used to knock the opponent through

Something to note is that this spell knocks the opponent upward a bit, making it not reliable for hitting players for the full 50. Aiming for the top of the player can help, but be careful with this spell.

There’s a trick used often in competitive play around digging very far with pebble shot. The way to do this is to fly up and then aim it directly down such that all the pebbles stay grouped up.

This is contrasted to throwing the pebbles sideways.

Something important is that pebble shot does not always deal the exact 5 damage, especially when near terrain. If you are using pebbles to deal exactly 50damage, make sure to not let the pebbles near any terrain.

There’s a kinda-trick around using pebbles against flighted players. The pebbles have enough knockback such that they will not fall on  you, so if you can get centered and close, you can deal almost the entire damage.This is not something you will see often so use at your own risk.
