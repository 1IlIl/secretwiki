## Quake


Quake is a rather unique spell as an Arena Type. Quake shakes the map, and such the players bounce around as well as towers taking damage(cog tower being the exception)

Aside from the specific damage figure of quake, there are not many simple things to say about it. This means that we will get directly into the hidden mechanics and otherwise tricks. One thing to mention is that quake usually knocks the player back and forth, however on the sea floor this does not exactly apply. What happens instead is after the initial bounce, the creature/player will bounce repeatedly in the same direction until interacting with terrain again.This can be extremely useful for sinking water lords.

Something important about quake is that it requires the player to move upward. This means boxing yourself into terrain can completely mitigate quake.

There is an interesting interaction with Snow Globe.
