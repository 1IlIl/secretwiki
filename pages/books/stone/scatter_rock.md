Scatter rock is known for being a reliable detower, however against fortress it falls slightly short even with a perfect show. On other towers, it will only fail to detower if all pebbles miss.

Many people wonder why scatter rock is better than pebbles. Well itâ€™s really not but the one advantage with scatter rock is the fact that it can be thrown long distances.
