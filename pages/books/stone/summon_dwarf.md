## Summon Dwarf 


Dwarf is a minion lacking mobility, but having a fairly powerful toolkit. Dwarf recently got a huge amount of complexity, so I will cover that, but first let’s just talk dwarf. First let’s talk about Mine. Mine is a spell that can be used to dig through terrain and even trap enemies.

It’s interesting that mine also can be used to fling enemies a fair amount.

When it comes to flinging however, kablam is one of the best. Just make sure to extend if you need to.

Something you might have noticed is that the dwarf runs away. This is part of the spell, and if you are careful, in some situations you can save the dwarf to attack again.

Oh did I mention it deals double damage to towers? Whoops yeah it’s very strong.Something important is that kablam also ignores static shield.This makes kablam one of the only tools stone has to answer static shield.

Shop is a whole big ol bag of rocks. I am just goin to explain the buffs and someone will have to tell me about any interesting tricks about it. I know there’s potentially a way to like drop someone into the shaft by spawning it perfectly center on them but aside from that there’s not much.

Scannox 5001:Adds a chance to get either a random spell or a random shop upgrade to dwarf while digging.(might be based on where digging on map as in-place doesn’t seem to give anything. You only get random spells after all the upgrades are acquired)

Miner Map:Much like the Elves Volley, miner map makes the miner cast mine at the start of each turn.The map can fall and when it sinks the miner stops mining.

Platinum Climbing Hooks: The dwarf sticks to walls and the jumps can be controlled by your mouse.

Shaft: Gives Dwarf the Mineshaft spell, which digs a particular structure in terrain that is scalable by both dwarf and players.

x2: Kablam’s blast radius is doubled and it now has a cooldown.

x3: Kablam’s blast radius is tripled and it now has a cooldown.
Yes x2 and x3 stack.

Finally, Myth is a new minion type introduced with the shop spell. It’s from Miner Disturbance lore, but to give you a hint on how to get it. Try grabbing a few upgrades then letting your opponent take control. This has nothing to do with my lack of knowledge around this achievement stfu.
