## Chain Lightning


Chain lightning may seem like a random spell, however it is not. Chain lightning will bounce predictable on predictable terrain. Because of how complex terrain is, and how much of it is nullified by Flight, some forget that terrain is incredibly complex.

While chain deals damage each time it bounces normally, hitting a tower has a unique interaction, bouncing multiple times in succession. This can make chain lightning an amazing spells to detower with.

Something else to understand is that when it comes to creatures and players. Chain lightning deals damage both when it bounces and also when it enters the creature. This means large minions like Kraken for example take almost no damage from chain lightning.

Something interesting is that minions within terrain, or living terrain has a similar interaction as towers. This makes targets that were swaparooâ€™d into terrain take a large amount of damage.

One trick that can be incredibly powerful is to use this mechanic with Forest Seed. Chain lightning can get past the tree, killing it, but trapping the chain within the tree with the player.
