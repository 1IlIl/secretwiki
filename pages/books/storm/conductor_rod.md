## Conductor Rod 


Conductor rod is a seriously scary storm spell, which causes lightning to fall from the top of the map.

The damage that conductor rod deals is based on the distance between caster and it’s target. This means that lobbing it across the entire map deals the maximum damage.

Something you might have notices is that the rod can stick to the player, making the lightning follow them.This happens when the rod hits a living creature. If this happens the rod becomes attached to them.Conductor rod, in addition to it’s initial damage, causes a strike to come down

This “sticking” effect lasts even through sinking.

This “sticking” effect also lasts even through …death?!.

Something useful about Conductor Rod is that is can deal damage through towers. This can be very useful.

Another trick is that Conductor Rod doesn’t know anything except it’s distance from cast location. This means that you can use things like portal to artificially buff it.

Another way to do this is to put the rod into a static shield.
