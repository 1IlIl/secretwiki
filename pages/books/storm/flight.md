## Flight 


Flight is an extremely powerful positioning spell which allows you to be precisely anywhere. On top of this, Flight lasts indefinitely and does not end your turn when you cast it.

There is so many things to talk about with flight. Hopefully I can cover it all, but there’s probably always going to be stuff to add. If you know something I am missing, please let me know. Now, Let’s start with the movement of flight. Moving in flight is done by using the normal walk and jump keys. Z and X will move you left and right, and High jump and Long Jump will move you up and down. Flight is unique in that you actually fly faster in the leftward direction than in the rightward direction.

Now sometimes you do small movements left and right and other times you make large ones. This is due to which direction you are facing when you move. You move a small amount if you are facing the opposite direction of the movement and large amounts if you are already facing the direction of the movement. To make small movements, you can flip flop between moves such that you are facing the opposite direction of the movement each time.

Moving precisely in the forwards direction can also be done by cycling up and down movements. This will move you slightly forward each time you move either up or down.

Moving precisely in the upwards direction can be done by this same method, moving up and down. Note here that each up and down movement ends you higher than you started slightly.Moving precisely downward is not as simple, however all you must do is use the rest of the tools, then use the fixed downward movement to finish the movement.

Something I probably should have mentioned earlier is that while flight is indefinite, it is broken by taking damage to your health.

A very very common way to get around this is to apply protection shield. If you take damage to protection shield, you are not deflighted.

While Flight may seem like the bee's knees, there are some downsides. While you are in flight, you cannot tower or cast certain other spells.

Like I have mentioned there are so many things to know about flight. Flight is one of the most important spells on arcanists. One such mechanic is that while you are flying, you can be very useful for moving minions around. This can be out of pits or even down the side of the map.

Something else you can do is what most refer to as “Olympics” in which you use some of the tricks about movement from before to carry minions horizontally as far as you want.

Another minion movement trick is this idea that you can “drop” minions using flight. This relies on the fact that minions will fall straight downward if you move from under them.

This comes in handy most often when you want to drop a minion down the side of a map without going outside the border.Walking around a minion will apply a forward momentum as they fall.

If you “drop” the minion, it will however not apply this force, and be able to reach the tree below.

Finally, the last thing I remembered to talk about it the knockback when dealing with flighted units. Flighted units can be knocked left, right, upward, however they cannot be knocked downward while flighted. In addition to this all knockback in the directions aforementioned is done at a significantly reduced effect.

Finally, Finally, A  flighted unit will take somewhat of a scaling knockback effect from multihit spells. Thundershock for example will send a flighted unit quite a ways away.
