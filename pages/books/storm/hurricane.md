##  Hurricane


Hurricane is a spell that generates a whirlwind around the caster, lifing creatures into the air and then eventually off the map.

Hurricane also works against flying minions, albeit they will not go outside the bounds of the map.

To get into the details a bit, how Hurricane works is there is a few phases. The first phase drags the creatures up and towards the caster. If the creatures get close enough to the player, they may swap “sides”. This concept of sides is what side the creature is in relation to the player. This is something that may not matter as much anymore due to buffs to Hurricane which made it more reliable, but still is a mechanic that exists.

Now why is this at all important you must be wondering. Hurricane was not always a reliable sink, and improving the outward “fling” is depending on how close the creature is to the player at the end of the first phase.

This means that you want your opponents to be as far as possible from the center when you cast this spell for the more extreme effect. Now the buff I mentioned before means that you almost never run into a situation that hurricane doesn’t “just work” but perhaps with flying players or creatures this can come in handy along with arma.

Something important to note is that hurricane doesn’t reliably pull players towards you at all. If a player has terrain above them,you almost certainly are not going to land a successful hurricane.

Hurricane doesn’t work like this either.

Something cool to note is that hurricane can throw napalm around. This can be quite dangerous for the caster, however at the end of the spell, all the napalm will no longer be near you.

There is this weird interaction with being mounted on water lord that can allow you to get around side with hurricane. It’s pretty creative to be honest. I was not the one to discover this.How to set this up is to face the Water Lord inward, then mount it, and hurricane.
