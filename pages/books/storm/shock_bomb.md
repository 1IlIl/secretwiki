## Shock Bomb



Shock bomb is a smaller than average bomb with a normal elasticity and an extremely low hitbox, which does not destroy terrain. This spell also has a good amount of knockback.

Something to note is that this extremely low hitbox can be useful for dealing a ton of damage through things.

If you miss in the below direction even by a little bit, shock bomb can easily do 0 damage. The falloff on this bomb is also extreme, meaning that being far can sometimes do as low as 30ish damage.

The hitbox being as wonky it is, It’s important to note that you need to land the bomb pretty close to the center of the player to knock the player upward. Landing it next to a player will most often send them sideways.

There is a trick of sorts similar to how it worked in the original game where you can drop it directly down onto someone’s head. It’s a bit tricky and you won’t often see it performed much in real games due to the unreliability. You sort of have to hit a sweet spot. If you hit too close to center, it will just knock them up and into you.

Shock bomb is one of the spells which has a custom 2 turn timer. This means that you cannot use this spell on turn 1. In addition to this, in a 1v1 environment, the player who goes first has an additional cooldown turn, making it available on turn 3.
