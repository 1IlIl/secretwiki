## Shock Shield 



Shock Shield is a unique shield in arcanists that creates a small hitbox around the player which deals 25 damage per turn, in 5 damage increments.This means that over 5 turns, this spell can deal up to 125 damage.

As you would expect, this shield is very weak versus Stone familiar or other creatures with per-projectile damage resistance effects.This means it can do as little as 5 damage per turn.

Something to note is that this damage will split between as many targets as are touching you at the start of the turn.

Something peculiar about Shock Shield is that you can knock players and creatures around with it. It typically pulls the creature toward the shield, so you sort of want to go below or above and knock them under or over you.

Something interesting about Storm Shield is that it can stun creatures even on other players' turns. This can be particularly useful for not dying to dark knight.

Storm shield often is comparable to the small aura on swarm. Unfortunately the radius on the small aura is larger, so you will be stunned first if you fly towards it. Luckily there is something important to know about movement which can help you to get your storm shield onto the swarm. How movement works is even though stunned, your flight movement is preserved, so all you need to do is make sure you have enough movement preserved to make it close enough. To do this just get as close as you can before the movement that enters you into the aura.
