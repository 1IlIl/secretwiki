## Storm 


Storm is a pretty lame level 3 in all honesty. It is pretty rng, but can deal quite a bit of damage sometimes.It stays around for 3 turns.The first cast is 9 strikes, then 7 strikes on the second turn, then 9 strikes again on the last turn.These strikes create chain lightning esqe particles that are what actually do the terrain destruction and deal a majority of the damage and knockback.

I have it from a reputable source that the lightning usually either targets towards the center or the outside, so given the right scenario, it can do quite a bit of damage, or very little.

While it may seem like there is some kind of intended synergy between conductor rod and storm, there is not. The only trick really to storm is that both Cyclops and Storm dragon are commonly used to prevent taking damage from it.
