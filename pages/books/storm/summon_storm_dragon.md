## Summon Storm Dragon 


Storm Dragon is another storm minion which is immune to storm damage. It has a 75 damage storm breath attack and thereâ€™s not really much else to say about it.

The only thing to mention is that this dragon breath , while looking like thundershock, has quite a bit larger aoe on it. It can actually deal the 75 damage to multiple nearby targets.

The other useful trick is that you can extend this breath, much like all spells in the game. Because Storm Dragon is particularly large, it extends quite far.
