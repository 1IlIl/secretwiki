## Summon Storm Spirit 


Storm shield is a pretty cool minion. It spawns with 25 health and can fly. It gets a version of  hurricane by default, and has a version of wind shield and shock shield.

The version of hurricane it gets sacrifices it as a requisite.

Similarly, while the wind shield that it gets seems similar, it has a 5tcd and is not as strong from the bottom.

It’s very important that  if you want to exploit this weakness from below that you do not let the projectile decelerate too much. This means making sure not to be too far from the spirit.

The spirit’s wind shield is also noticeably shorter in duration than the player’s. It’s even shorter than Flame Shield.

You can also break Storm Spirit Shield horizontally with an arrow or ball spell..

Something not everyone considers is that storm spirit exists before flight. Make sure to use it if you can!
