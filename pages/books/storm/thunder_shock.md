## Thunder Shock


Thunder shock is a somewhat unique bolt spell in arcanists that cannot deal self damage.

Thunder shock’s other properties is that is has a very small thin terrain destruction and is precise.

Thunder Shock also creates a good deal of knockback if used in the right way. The trick is to aim at the bottom of the player, and since the initial explosion was added, avoid being too close when trying to knock back the player. It can be a bit tricky at first but with a little practice it’s not hard.

I mentioned the Initial explosion, but I haven’t yet explained it. Thunder Shock has a 0 damage explosion at the start which destroys a player sized terrain.

Something you might have noticed is that the initial explosion is pretty far from the player. This is another new mechanic that was introduced when the initial explosion happened. Something interesting about this is is can be used to fire through minions.

If you just want to deal damage with this spell, make sure to aim at the top of the opponent such that they wont knock around as much.

Dealing maximum damage to flying targets can be done in a few ways. One such way is to get horizontal to them and push them for the entire duration of the spell. As an added bonus this can be used to sink opponents.

Another strategy is to fire and knock them towards you. This can be cone by not extending, but firing through the center of the player. This again is based on the origin starting so far away.

Finally, a somewhat fun trick is to use full illusion to walk through the terrain cutout.Something to watch out for is that the origin can be so far that it doesn’t break enough terrain. Just be careful to back up first such that there’s a big enough hole to get through.
