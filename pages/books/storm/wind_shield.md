## Wind Shield 


Wind Shield is simple, but powerful spell. Out of all the deflection based spells , Wind Shield is generally the strongest in terms of raw push.

How Wind Shield works is it activates whenever a spell is cast. This means that is always activated, much unlike Flame Shield for example.

Thereâ€™s not many things to say about Wind Shield. Like all deflection based shields. Arcane Bomb and spells that can outlast the effect do work to mitigate it.This is because after a target enters the effector(the shield area), it starts a countdown until it stops blocking. This is the most long on wind shield, however it MUST end before bombs can explode with arcane bomb for an example.

Get on out there and block all the things!(Except things I cast pls&ty)
