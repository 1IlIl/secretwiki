## Aura of Decay 


Aura of Decay is a pretty strong effect that you can place on the map. It deals 15 damage when a minion enters it, and it activates at the start of the turn for 5 turns. It can only activate once per turn, however if multiple things are within it at the start of a turn, it will hit both.Most things that move into aura are stunned such that they cannot move afterwards. This means that aura of decay can be an incredibly useful area denial spell.

The exceptions to this are undead minions and minions with a protection shield that was applied after the turn that the aura of decay was cast.

Something to note is that having prot is not enough to prevent the stun. If you have a protection shield that was applied first, then the aura will still stun you.

Similarly to what I mentioned in the swarm section, there is a concept that minions hit by auras will check if there is anything below them, then apply damage to the minion below them as well.

While players will often move out of the aura if you place it on them, towers cannot always do the same, making aura of decay very useful for hitting players in towers,leaving them to eventually take the full 75 or leave the tower.
