## Dark Defences


Dark Defences is a misspelled shield which siphons the health of casters’ minions to the caster. It lasts as long as you have minions to siphon.

This means that if you take damage and do not have any minions, it will break.

DD will also break if you cast it without minions, cast it and all your minions die on that turn, or walk into a Sanctuary.

While multiple minions heal you 1:1, in which 1 minion health heals you 1, not all minions are this way. Kraken will heal you at a rate of 1:4, in which 4 kraken health is required to heal 1, and Water Lord heals at a rate of 1:2, in which 2 health is required to heal the player one.

In addition to this, it’s important to remember that if there are multiple minions, it will try to take health from each equally, splitting the cost of dark defenses.This health is split based on player and not the modifier of the minion, meaning a split from the player taking 4 damage will deal 2 to a flame dragon and 4 to a water lord if those are your two minions being siphoned.
