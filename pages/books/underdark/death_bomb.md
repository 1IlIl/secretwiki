## Death Bomb


Death Bomb is a bomb spell in arcanists 2 which explodes for 40 damage, spawning an Aura of Decay, which deals 75 damage over the course of 5 turns, including the turn that it was cast.

The aura spawns at the same time as the damage from the explosion, meaning that while the explosion is not death damage, it can still zombify living minions that are below at or below 55 health.

Death bomb is a very powerful spell for zombifying things, especially versus mounted minions. I won’t cover how damage against mounted units works here, however it’s important to note that a full health mounted pegasus is succeptable to getting zombied by death bomb.

Death bomb is particularly small for a bomb, at least it’s collision is. The art is somewhat larger than it’s effective size. This means that it can slip though smaller terrain.Being small can also lead to aiming incorrectly for very precise shots.

While many spells deal 50 damage, this spell deals 55 in the first turn, making it useful for hitting through Protection shield.
