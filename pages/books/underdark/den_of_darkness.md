The aura around it deals 15 damage per turn, and only hits a target once per turn.This damage is death damage, meaning it can turn minions into zombies.

In addition to this aura effect, Den of Darkness also heals 30HP at the start of each turn. You do not need to the aura to hit anything for the heal effect.
