## Drain Bolt


Drain bolt is an ubiquitous spell on Arcanists 2. It deals 30 damage, and heals you.

If you hit two targets with this spell, it will heal you for each.

Something important to note is that there are a few limitations on this healing. One limitation is the health of the caster. If the caster is below 30 health, then they can only heal at most the health that they are currently.

This healing limitation of the player does not mean that you can only end up with double/triple/etc your health. If you hit two targets, you can heal that X(where X is your health) from the first target, then from the other you heal Y(where Y is limited by the health you have after the first heal resolves). This means if the first target heals you to above 30, then you get the full heal from the second target.

The other limitation of drain is how much health the target has. If a target of drain has less than 30 health, then you will only get health equal to the amount of the health the target had.

The other, maybe obvious to many, part is what minions can be drained and what can be drained. There are a few different minion types, Soulbound,Living,Undead, and Arcane. Of these four, only Living and Soulbound minions will give the caster health. Something else to note is that Forest Seed, the living terrain spell, can also be drained for health.

Now the next thing to talk about is drain’s damage, and more importantly, how it’s explosion is one of the few which does not damage the player. A simple way to think of this is that draining yourself leads to 30 healing, however the explosion dealt you 30 damage; this is not at all how it works, it’s simply that the explosion deals you no damage, but it’s probably the logic behind why it was designed this way.

If the caster is undead, they will take damage from drain. This, for the player, often means if you are lich.

Some undead minions get drain as well, and this rule applies to them as well.

Finally, drain bolt has a fair bit of knockback and it can come in handy. It can move you, move your opponent, etc. Just remember it exists.
