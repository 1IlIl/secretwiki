## Lichdom


Lichdom is a spell in arcanists which turns you into an undead creature. It limits your spells, makes you heal from death damage, On top of this you heal for a percentage of the damage that you deal.

The spell restrictions on Lichdom work as follows: You man cast Arcane or Underdark spells only and you cannot cast towers.

Damage you deal, regardless of source, heals you for 50% of the damage rounded down.

As an undead creature, you heal from death damage.

Make sure you remember that drain also hurts undead creatures.

Something important to note is this aura that follows you around makes it very difficult to summon swarms. If you summon one while it is active, it will die when your next turn starts, not allowing you to use it at all. To get swarms after casting lichdom, you must first deactivate your aura and then summon it, accepting that it will still take 15 damage at the start of your next turn.

There actually is some knockback associated with aura of decay, so you can actually sort of avoid the last thing I mentioned by summoning the swarm as high as possible, which will knock the swarm out of your aura and prevent it from dying on the following turn.

There's no turning back, so make sure you lichdom responsibly.
