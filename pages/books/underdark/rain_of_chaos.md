## Rain of Chaos


Rain of Chaos is a chaotic aerial spell. 7 Skulls spawn in, and do a sort of loop. This spell is fairly RNG dependent and map height dependent. The height around the loop is the most unreliable, and the bottom of the map is also fairly unreliable.Thereâ€™s a sweet spot around the middle of the map where the spread is usable.

Something important to know is that these skull projectiles come with quite a deal of knockback.This can make Rain of Chaos quite the chaotic spell.

One trick with rain of chaos is that the skulls almost always bunch up at the top border of the map. This means that if your opponent or their minion is against the top of the map, then rain of chaos stands to deal a great deal of damage.
