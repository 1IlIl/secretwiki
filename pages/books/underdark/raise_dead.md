There’s not really much to say about raise dead, however in close quarters, it becomes sort of the replacement to drain bolt for liches. This is because drain bolt deals damage to undead minions, meaning instead of going even to deal 30 damage, you heal 25(lich has it’s own damage to health multiplier so ignoring that extra +2 or so) and deal 25.
