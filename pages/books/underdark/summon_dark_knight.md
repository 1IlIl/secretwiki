## Summon Dark Knight


Dark Knight is an incredibly powerful minion in Arcanists 2. It is 100 hp and is resistant to knockback effects.

Dark Knight has two spells. One is drain, and it works exactly like it does for the player, but another, which is unique to dark knight, is Charge. Charge is an incredibly powerful spell which can deal upwards of 260 damage.

Charge will stop if it interacts with any damaging or stunning effect. This could be an aura, shock shield, napalm ,or any other effect.

There’s a few different ways to maximize damage. One thing to note is that dk will jump up and down if aiming up. This means a player that is above dk will take quite a bit of damage.

Similarly, a Charge that is aimed down will dig, such that both the dk and the target may fall down the hole. This means using Charge downwards will deal quite a bit of damage as well.

Something to note about this configuration is that whatever is above the dk will take no damage. This means you can stand on top of the dk in order to set up a trap from this.

While in OG spells mode, there is an alternative trick to dealing a lot of damage with Charge. This trick is called Dark Knight Hump, or DKH. I will explain meticulously how to maximize it. First you want your dk to be on top of the player and not quite centered. Then simply zoom in to the Dark Knight and look for a vertical shading line that splits the main color of the mask from the shaded part.Aim slightly below the start of the black border of the hand down vertically from that line I mentioned first. Do this as I do and you will have it.

There’s another way to trap players with Charge which involves ending the charge with the Dark Knight within the player. This can be a bit tricky to learn, however it can be very powerful.

The answer to this type of trap is usually to realize it has happened. Some variations of this trap only work if you walk as your first movement. If you instead jump first, you can sometimes get out.

There’s definitely a bit of jankness to this however I hope to have a section at some point which covers more the interactions of two creatures within eachother which should answer any further questions.

There is another trick where you can deal damage through towers using Charge. I believe how this works is the charge needs to temporarily stop hitting the tower such that the detowering can happen. This is achieved by using the “hopping” effect of dk to bounce onto the tower to detower, fall to let them detower, then hop again to deal damage through tower.
