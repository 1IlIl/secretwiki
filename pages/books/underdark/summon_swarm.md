## Summon Swarm


<span style="color:red">This needs to be updated due to the swarm changes</span>


Swarm is one of the more powerful and meta minions in Arcanists 2. It is a small flying minion with a miniature aura of decay around it. This miniature aura of decay deals 15 damage and then deactivates.  This aura can only hit once a turn , as it activates at the start of each turn. This damage is death damage, meaning that it can turn and heal zombies.

I will cover Aura Stacking in it’s own section, but it’s important to note that, to put it simply, a minion hit by this aura will check below it and then deal equal damage to the minion below it.

Something to mention is that this aura will stun friendly minions, or even the player if you aren't careful. Doing this prevents the unit from moving any more on that turn.

When it comes to swarms, it’s important to note that running a swarm into the opponent’s swarm, the one who did the moving will die first and only.

Swarm has a unique interaction with the side of the map, such that it can break into the border a tiny bit.This allows it to fit around certain map generations of Grassy Hills.

Something else to note about swarm is that if you are precise enough, you can hit two targets with it at once. Because they are most likely on top of eachother , this will deal 30 to the bottom one and 15 to the top one.
