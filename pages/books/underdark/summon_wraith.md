## Summon Wraith 


Summon Wraith is a 50HP flying minion which is unique in that it spawns as an undead minion. This means it heals from death damage. And loses health at the start of each turn.

While i will cover this again when I cover the minion types, it’s important to note that this minion takes double damage from sphere of healing and other light spells.

Finally, like other undead minions it’s not stunned by Aura of Decay.
