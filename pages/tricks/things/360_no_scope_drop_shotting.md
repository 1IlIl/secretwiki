### 360 No Scope Drop Shotting


There’s three different phases of the autopilot when you fire an arrow spell in Arcanists. The first phase is curving towards the target point. The second phase is curving beyond/through the target point. And the third is free flight.


#### Phase 1:


Getting the biggest arc with arrows requires throwing it 180 degrees away from the target, however you need to be aware that the arrow will curve to which side of the target you aim it closer to. This means you actually want it roughly 175 degrees, so that the arrow curves the correct direction.

#### Phase 2:


Arrows continue to curve towards the target point for x seconds. It’s that simple .This means that you can actually further curve arrows by using this knowledge. If the arrow is going downward(falling) when it goes through the target point, it will curve downwards, if it is going upwards(rising) when it hits the target point, it will curve upwards.

#### Phase 3:


Arrows after a certain point will stop curving and start free falling as if they were a ball spell. This happens fairly similarly except for 2 arrows. Arcane arrows will free fall much sooner in terms of shooting them over distance as the slow speed of arcane arrows lets them free fall closer. The other exception is cog arrow, which instead of free falling explodes into cogs.
