### Aerials and the Tops and Bottoms of the world 

Certain Targeted/Aerial Spells stop behaving outside of the boundaries that pur3 expected us to play within. I sort of figured this out while trying to determine how to optimize the targeting on Firework Show. If you cast a spell past a certain point at the top of the map while zoomed out, the spell will fire upward and in the opposite direction that it normally would. There is a certain point where the spell will also fire at less/0 velocity, however It is not consistent to show here. As for the bottom of the map, firework show is the only spell that I know of that can be abused by aiming as low as possible. In this case targeting it at the bottom of the map causes both sets of 3 new years rockets to crash much faster than normally.
