### Arrows and low power entry


Sometimes you can make shots that don’t look possible by using arrows at a low power, if you are not too aggressive with the angle, then you can get a slight curve at the beginning of the trajectory.Too much angle however and the arrow will enter it’s normal arc and overshoot your target.
