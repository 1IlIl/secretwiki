### Aura Stacking


Mounted units take damage for being stacked on top of eachother as well as for the mounted unit taking damage. This means they take 15*3.


Single Stacked units take 15 extra damage if the minion on top of it got hit by aura, so if you hit only the top unit, it will do 15 to both, if you hit both, it will do 15 to the top and 30 to the bottom.


You can now double stack units, which means you can stack 2 small units on a large one. In my example I used 2 brine goblins on top of a pegasus. This means that the pegasus took 15 from aura, and 15 for each brine on top of it that is affected by aura.
