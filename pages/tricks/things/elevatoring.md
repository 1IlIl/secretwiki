### Elevatoring


The first way to Elevator the DK is to put the flying creature against the edge of the map, put the dk on it, and drop it down. This is usually used when there is a tree against the edge of the map and you might have blown a swarm sized path through it using bftp. The dk can hang off the edge of the map. I will probably record this again with a tree there. Another method is to alternate ctrl and f(flip flop) so that you do not need the edge of the map. I asked for feedback on this section and the person told me to high jump it rather than long jump, and while they are correct, long jump is badass so I leave for now.
