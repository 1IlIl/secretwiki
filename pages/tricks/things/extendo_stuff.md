## Extendo Stuff


### Extendo and what it actually means
Extendo, or Extend, or Alt, Whatever you want to call it, it’s the functionality they want you to think is just about throwing spells further. Nah, it comes in handy in other ways. One of the tricks is that extendo  actually starts the projectile further away from the character.

### Arrow/Spells through tree
You can use extendo to fire spells at near 45 degree angles through a tree trap.I’m sure there are more useful spells than frost arrow, hmu if you find one and I’ll add it to the wiki.

### Arcane Bomb
This trick is used a lot by arcane monsters as arcane bomb seems like the only bomb that respects using extend to place it into the opponent. What this means is the child objects, the arcane arrows, will hit the target at a higher chance, allowing for you to basically have a 40 damage sink. Aside from that Arcane bomb sucks; smh even talking about it makes me sort of sad.

### How tf they get out of tree with Flash
Nikaray’s guide probably has this section as well, so I’m not spending 10 minutes typing about flashing trees; that’s for the arch mages.

### Larger creatures extendo further


Extending spells starts spells further from the cast than normal. This amount of distance from the caster is proportional to caster size. Larger creatures can extend further, as seen by arcane monsters and dragons commonly.
