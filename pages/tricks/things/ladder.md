### Ladder

*after grapplepi wasn’t sure about ladder and asked strong player to explain so they made sure not to butcher this section. grapplepi was completely wrong on what ladder meant*

”Ladder is used when you give your teammate a tower or minion so they can reach to the other side of a high point” - Usman889

“haha well tbh like Idk if that is just more terminology than a trick at that point, so maybe I remove at some point, but for now I like having the section”-grapplepi

Using your own minion to move dk or something harder to maneuver like stone golem also called ladder ye
