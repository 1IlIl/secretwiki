### Make your bombs sticky. 


Just make the bomb caress your opponent bro. To get serious, how the physics work is that a bomb will stick when it reaches a slow enough speed regardless of if it should fall down, so in reality throwing bombs has nothing to do with where the opponent is positioned and if gravity would make the bomb roll/fall downward due to its shape.
