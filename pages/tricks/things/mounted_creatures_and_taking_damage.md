### Mounted creatures and taking damage


If a creature that is mounted takes damage, that is if the explosion radius of the attack reaches the creature that is mounted, that minion that is mountable will take damage in itâ€™s place. This means small explosion spells will hit normally, large explosion spells will hit for the normal direct damage as well as the splash on the mounted unit. In addition to this, if the mounted minion were to die from the direct hit damage, the mounted unit will take the splash damage directly.

Zombie Creatures do not take damage for their riders,instead damage just directly passes to the rider as well even though the mount takes the damage that the rider would have taken on top of the normal damage of the projectile.
