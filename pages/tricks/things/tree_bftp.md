### Tree BFTP

10pc’s video does a good job explaining and showing this. I am not really all that good at this trick, so I am going to rely on 10pc being good at explaining it. This trick is much better in video form; once I figure out a workaround for google doc’s limitation of embedded videos, I will update this section.(nvm too lazy)
